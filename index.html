  <h2 class="mtp">About Me</h2><br>
  <p>Hello World! I'm Narjis, a proud tech enthusiast, coding aficionado and globetrotter who's fascinated with the intricacies of AI.
<br><br>
          I'd definitely say my curiosity is the main trait that has driven the progression of my life.
          I was born in Marseille, France and have lived in Canada, Australia, South Korea, Portugal,
          United Kingdom and most notably China, where I spent an enlightening 7 years soaking up the culture.
          Across my travels, I've experienced a lot of different types of work, cultures and disciplines.
          After returning to Europe after my stint in China, I became a lot more interested in tech,
          beginning my journey into product management, using the at-home time that the pandemic forced
          us into to pick up some new skills.
<br><br>
          As a polyglot product manager with a background in account management and business development, I've had
          to don several hats in my professinnal career. These experiences, coupled with my adaptability
          and knack for embracing new environments, prepared me for to jump into dynamic world of tech.
          So, here I am, at the intersection of my passion for AI and my expertise in product management,
          ready to make my mark in a more technical domain.</p>

        <h1 class="mtb">Road to Code</h2><br>
        <p>
          Embarking on the road to coding has been nothing short of a thrilling
          expedition for me. It all started with the basics - HTML and CSS. As I
          started to feel more comfortable with it, I decided to give JavaScript
          a try, where interactivity became my new (nemesis) best friend. These
          days I am knee deep Python and trying to build some data science skills.<br><br />

          Throughout this journey, I've realized I am a problem-solver at heart,
          someone who relishes the challenge of a good Sudoku puzzle and finds
          beauty in a well-written line of code. So, it's clear to me that software
          development should be more than just a hobby for me; it's the perfect
          destination for this journey I'm on.</p>

              Allow me to introduce my first-ever attempt at building a game project,
              born out of my absolute obsession for this thing. Sudoku has been
              my daily getaway for years, so it seemed fitting that I would take
              a shot at building my own spin on it. Stay  tuned for some more Sudoku

              I embarked on a  journey of curiosity with FreeCodeCamp, and what
              started as a spark of interest soon turned into my new favorite hobby.
              My curiosity rewarded me with multiple certifications, which at the
              very least go to show the hours I've happily put in so far,
              and will continue to do.üì±</br>
