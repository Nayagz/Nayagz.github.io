        <p class="about-text">
          Hello World! I'm Narjis, a proud tech enthusiast, coding aficionado
          and globetrotter who's fascinated with the intricacies of AI.
          <br /><br />
          I'd definitely say my curiosity is the main trait that has driven the
          progression of my life. I was born in Marseille, France and have lived
          in Canada, Australia, South Korea, Portugal, United Kingdom and most
          notably China, where I spent an enlightening 7 years soaking up the
          culture. Across my travels, I've experienced a lot of different types
          of work, cultures and disciplines. After returning to Europe after my
          stint in China, I became a lot more interested in tech, beginning my
          journey into product management, using the at-home time that the
          pandemic forced us into to pick up some new skills.
          <br /><br />
          As a polyglot product manager with a background in account management
          and business development, I've had to don several hats in my
          professinnal career. These experiences, coupled with my adaptability
          and knack for embracing new environments, prepared me for to jump into
          dynamic world of tech. So, here I am, at the intersection of my
          passion for AI and my expertise in product management, ready to make
          my mark in a more technical domain.

        <h2 class="med-title">Roadmap to coding</h2>
        <p class="about-text">
          Embarking on the road to coding has been nothing short of a thrilling
          expedition for me. It all started with the basics - HTML and CSS. As I
          started to feel more comfortable with it, I decided to give JavaScript
          a try, where interactivity became my new (nemesis) best friend. These
          days I am knee deep Python and trying to build some data science
          skills.<br /><br />

          Throughout this journey, I've realized I am a problem-solver at heart,
          someone who relishes the challenge of a good Sudoku puzzle and finds
          beauty in a well-written line of code. So, it's clear to me that
          software development should be more than just a hobby for me; it's the
          perfect destination for this journey I'm on.

          üì±Here's a playful, yet professional take on that: I embarked on a
          journey of curiosity with FreeCodeCamp, and what started as a spark of
          interest soon turned into an enriching expedition. My dedication and
          thirst for learning rewarded me with multiple certifications,
          testament to the countless hours I've happily devoted to this
